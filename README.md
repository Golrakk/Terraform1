This project is an introduction to Terraform

To launch, make sure that the launch.sh and end.sh files can be executed (chmod +1 name)

Then type "./launch" to start the infrastructure. It should open a container that will install the necessery components to launch a fastApi "Hello World" app
To stop it, type /stop

It is to be noted that docker won't install fastAPI on some computers. However, it works on other and I can't understand why it doesn't work on other.
I hope it works on yours!
